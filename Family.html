<h3>The Loudens of Ontario, Canada and Cleveland, Ohio</h3>

<p>
Our immediate family line emigrated from Glasgow to Canada in the early 1800's and settled near Peterborough, Ontario by the 1830's. My Grandfather, William Irwin, was born in
Fenlon Falls, Ontario in April 4, 1890 and married Kathleen Given (b. May 25, 1892, d. 4/21/1979 Euclid, OH) from nearby Bobcaygen, Ontario.
William Irwin's parents were John Lowden and Sarah Jane Irwin. Kathleen's parents were William Robinson Given (of Bobcageon, Ontario b. 1842 d. 1924) and Margaret Jane Begg (b. 1860 d. 1900).
Kathleen's uncle, John C. Begg, a Canadian citizen, came to the US during the Civil War as part of the 47th New York Light Infantry. He died during the Battle of Gettysburg.</p>

<p>My father, William Hugh, (b. January 1, 1912, Peterborough, Ontario; d. July 31, 1986) came to the US in the 1930's. He became a US citizen in 10/15/1943 in Bizerte, Tunisia while serving with the 969th Air Engineers of the 15th US Army Air Force.</p>
