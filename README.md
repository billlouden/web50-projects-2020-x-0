<li>four different .html pages,
<li>navigation to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
<li>one list (ordered or unordered),
<li>one table, and
<li>at least one image.
<li>one stylesheet file. Your stylesheet(s)
<ul><li>five different CSS properties, and at least
 <li>five different types of CSS selectors.</ul>
<li>use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
<li>at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens
</ul>

at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap's grid model.
Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable,
at least one example of SCSS nesting, and
at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what's contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.
