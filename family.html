The Louden's are are sept of the Campbell clan (Campbell of Loudoun) and were known for their fierce defense of Scotland's Lowlands. in the 13th and 14th centuries. The Scot patriot, William Wallace, (1273-1305) was the grandson of Sir Hugh Crawford de Loudoun, and the Wallace Sword was displayed in the Loudoun Castle until the sword was sold at auction in 1930.</p>
