      <TD><P><B>Origin of the Name</B>
<p>The name's origin came from a nearby landmark -- Loudoun Hill.

The ancient Scotto - Saxon word <i>Law</i> or <i>Low</i>,
meaning "fire" and the Scotto - Irish word <i>Dun</i>, meaning "hill" fits well
with the fact that Loudoun Hill is an ancient volcano.  Ancient settlements
near Loudoun Hill can be traced back to the Neolithic Age (4000-2400 B.C.)
lending much credence to this theory.  Another theory is that the name comes
from the Celtic <em>loddon</em> meaning "marshy ground."

<p>Its high ground made Loudoun Hill a strategic stronghold and many battles
were fought and forts built nearby.  The Romans occupied and built a fort a
few hundred yeards from Loudoun Hill in 80 A.D.  Vykings were a considerable
influence and built several forts nearby between 800-1200 A.D.

<p>The Lands of Loudoun were granted to James de Lambinus in 1169 by
Richard de Morvelle, High Constable of Scotland under King Wiliam I,
The Lion.  James, of Norman descent, took the name James de Lowdun upon
receipt of the lands.  "Lowdun" was changed over time to "Loudoun."

<p>The Loudoun's are a sept of the Campbell clan (Campbell of Loudoun) and
were known for their fierce defense of Scotland's Lowlands in the 13th and
14th centuries.

       <TD><B>Loudoun Castle</B>
	      <p>The present castle is located near Galston (20 km South of Glasgow).
              The present castle is the 5th on the site and was often called
        	the "The Windsor of Scotland" for its elegance. It was built in the
        	early 1800s and burnt down during WWII. It was not restored.  Instead it
           was given to Scotland as a National Heritage Landmark.</p></TD>
